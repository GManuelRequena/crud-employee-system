# Crud Employee Management System

This is the backend of a CRUD system of employees that has Swagger enabled so you can test it directly with backend.
It is being build with Java 17.0.4, Swagger 3.0.0, Gradle 7.5.1 and Spring Boot 2.7.12 and uses Microsft SQL Server as Database with JPA.

Once you are running the project you can access Swagger by [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html).

It has the basic funtionalities working but I'm still adding more features and docs.
