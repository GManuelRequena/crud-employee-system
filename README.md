# Crud Employee Management System

This is the backend of a CRUD system of employees that has Swagger enabled so you can test it directly with backend.

Once you are running the project you can access Swagger by [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)

It has the basic funtionalities working but I'm still adding more features and docs
